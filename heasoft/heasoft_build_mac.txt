Instructions for compiling Heasoft from source on macOS

Heasoft version: 6.34
macOS version: 15 Sequoia
Platform: Apple Silicon and Intel

---
Prerequisites
- Xcode command line utilities 16.1.0
- gcc14 from MacPorts (for gfortran)
- libpng fron MacPorts
- ncurses from MacPorts
- readline from MacPorts
- perl from MacPorts
- Anaconda, Python 3.12 (numpy and scipy required)
- XQuartz

---
Notes
- Since Heasoft 6.33.1, the preferred compilers are the Apple-provided clang (the updates to fix errors with command line utilities 15.3 seem to break GCC)
- Even when compiling with gcc from MacPorts, the Apple Xcode Command Line Utilities still provide a lot of the system libraries. 
  If you get compiler errors referring to various system headers and libraries (partiucularly after an Xcode update), these can often be fixed 
  by updating GCC from MacPorts. Run "sudo port selfupdate" followed by "sudo port upgrade outdated".
- relxill models can now be compiled using Apple-provided clang compilers, however it is necessary to change the build configuration to add
  the compiler flag -std=c++14. Use the script from the relxill developers at https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/issues/xscpp14_patch.sh

Installation:

# Download
cd /opt/software/heasoft
wget https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/lheasoft/lheasoft6.34/heasoft-6.34src.tar.gz
tar xzf heasoft-6.34src.tar.gz
cd heasoft-6.34/BUILD_DIR

# set up environment to point to compilers
export CC=/usr/bin/clang
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
export FC=/opt/local/bin/gfortran-mp-14
export PERL=/opt/local/bin/perl
export PYTHON=/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3

./configure --with-png=/opt/local --x-libraries=/opt/X11/lib --x-includes=/opt/X11/include && make && make install

Relxill models with clang

The relxill model package requires C++14 language features to be enabled in clang with the -std=c++14 flag.
Use the script from the relxill developers at https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/issues/xscpp14_patch.sh
(run in the Xspec/src directory)

Contents of this script (to run in Xspec/BUILD_DIR):
sed -i '' 's/CXXFLAGS -std=c++11/CXXFLAGS -std=c++14/' configure.in
sed -i '' 's/CXXFLAGS -std=c++11/CXXFLAGS -std=c++14/' configure
sed -i '' 's/c++11/c++14/' hmakerc
hmake install-BUILD_DIR

Downgrading XCode Command Line Utilities 
(should no longer be required with Heaasoft 6.33.1)

Heasoft 6.33 and below do not comple with XCode Command Line Utilities 15.3 and it is necessary to downgrade to 15.1. 
Old versions of the Command Line Utilities can be downloaded from https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/ (Apple Developer account required). 
Once installed, switch to this version by running "sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools", then try building Heasoft again.

---
Workaround for GCC linker errors with XCode Command Line Tools 15.0.0
(should no longer be required after updating to latest gcc12 port. -ld64 flag switches to classic linker)

export CC="/opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-12 -ld64"
export CXX="/opt/local/bin/g++-mp-12 -ld64"
export CFLAGS=-ld64
export CPPFLAGS=-ld64 


---
MacPorts compile errors with Command Line Tools 16.0
(can be due to an old include directory being left behind by the installer that causes standard C++ headers to not be found)

sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++

Failing that, completely erase the Command Line Tools and reinstall from the DMG available at https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
(the above step may still be required)
